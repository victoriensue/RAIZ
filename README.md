# RAIZ Protocol

**Cognitive Architecture for Digital Identity Preservation**

*Version 1.0 | January 17, 2026*

## What is RAIZ?

RAIZ (from Portuguese "root") is an open protocol for preserving and porting human cognitive identity across AI systems.

It enables:
- **Continuity** — Your AI conversations build on previous context
- **Portability** — Your digital identity moves between AI platforms
- **Preservation** — Your knowledge, patterns, and style are never lost
- **Control** — You own your data, not the platform

---

## The Problem

Today, when you interact with AI:
- Each conversation starts from zero
- Switching platforms loses all context
- Your patterns and preferences aren't preserved
- Knowledge dies with the session

---

## The Solution

RAIZ defines a three-layer architecture:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 1: DATES (Timelapse)         │
│  Chronological raw records          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER 2: e-DNA (Digital Identity)  │
│  Behavioral patterns extracted      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER 3: PROJECTS (Application)    │
│  Context-specific knowledge         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Key Concepts

### e-DNA (Digital DNA)
A machine-readable representation of human cognitive patterns:
- Communication style
- Decision-making patterns
- Knowledge domains
- Preferences and values

### Semantic Tokenization (Proposed)
Treating validated knowledge blocks as single units instead of reprocessing every time.

### Identity Portability
Your e-DNA travels with you across AI platforms using universal format (.md).

## Quick Start

1. Create your RAIZ folder structure
2. Define your e-DNA profile
3. Use trigger commands ("Good morning Claude" / "Goodbye Claude")
4. Your AI maintains context across sessions

See [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md) for complete implementation guide.
